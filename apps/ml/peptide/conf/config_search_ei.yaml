# the defaults list let you override settings using config files from subdirectories
# for models, specify the model name on the left hand side (which corresponds to a subdirectory)
# and the name on the right hand side specifies one of the config files in that subdirectory.
# This lets you have different sets of options for a model

defaults:
  - input: 2022_ei_search  # input data set
  - setup: single_gpu_search  # experiment setup parameters that are not typical hyperparameters
  - logging: mlflow_tensorboard_local  # logging setup
  - ml/model: ResNetBaseline  # model parameters.  model is searched for in paths.modules.models. The filename on the right hand side doesn't have to be the name of the model class.
  - ml/embedding: search_embedding  # embedding to use
  - ms: ei_search  # mass spec parameters
  - paths: standard  # places to look for classes and data
  - hydra/job_logging: default
  - _self_

# Information
#
# this configuration file is parsed by the hydra library.  See https://hydra.cc/ for info
#
# Notes:
# - environment variables can be retrieved via ${oc.env:MY_ENV_VARIABLE} notation
# - null values are translated to None values in python
# - values within the specification can be accessed via ${my_top_level.my_config_value} notation
#
# - Some hydra terminology:
#   - config:  a configuration file.  there are input configs arranged in a directory structure and one output config
#   - config_group : A path to a set of configs.
#       The path is relative to the containing config. It can be made absolute by prefixing it with a /.
#        The path separator is / regardless of the operating system.
#   - package : Where to place the content of the config within the output config. It is relative to the package of
#     the containing config by default.
#   - dot.notation: location of a key in the config
#

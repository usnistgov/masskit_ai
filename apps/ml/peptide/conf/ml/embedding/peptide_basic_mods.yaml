max_len: 40  # maximum length of embedding
min_charge: 1  # the minimum charge in the embedding
max_charge: 8  # the maximum charge in the embedding
channel_first: True  # is tensor format channel first (True for pytorch, False for tensorflow)
# which embedding class to use.  See peptide_embed.py for implementations
embedding_type: EmbedPeptide
# which embeddings from embedding_type to use.
# for EmbedPeptide, includes:
# peptide: one hot encoding of peptide sequence
# mods: one hot encoding of mods. List of mods is ml.embedding.peptide.mods
# charge: one hot encoding of charge over [min_charge, max_charge]
# charge_singleton: encode charge over a range of [0, 1]
# nce: one hot encoding of nce_bins
# nce_singleton: encode nce over a range of [0, 1]
